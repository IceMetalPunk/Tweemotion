## Realtime Twitter Sentiment Analysis
### By IceMetalPunk

Tweemotion is (or will be, depending on when you're reading this) a Web app that will give you realtime sentiment analysis of any topic based on Twitter posts.

Planned features:
* Enter a search term, and an Analysis Feed will begin.
* You'll see a score, updated in realtime, indicating how positively or negatively that search term is being discussed on Twitter.
* A sliding-window line graph will display the last N tweets' sentiment scores, so you can see how it's changing over time.
* User accounts will let you save your samples, thereby collecting more data with each Tweemotion session.
* Saved user sample data can be embedded as chart images or grabbed via a RESTful API.

Possible-but-not-guaranteed features:
* Comparisons of sentiments between two or more search terms.
